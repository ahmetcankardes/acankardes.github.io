title: "AUVSI SUAS 2022 Technical Missions"
excerpt: "AUVSI SUAS is an annual competition that challenges student teams to design, build, and operate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones). The competition typically involves a series of missions that test the capabilities of the teams' autonomous systems. These missions often include tasks such as autonomous flight, target identification, and payload delivery.<br/><img src='/images/kesekci_4.png'>"

## Competition Tasks

### Autonomous Flight

In the Autonomous Flight mission, teams are tasked with ensuring their Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can fly autonomously for a minimum of 3 minutes. The transition between autonomous and manual mode must be communicated to the safety judge, with a focus on precise waypoint navigation.

### Obstacle Avoidance

Obstacle Avoidance is crucial for UAS integration into airspace. Teams need to showcase effective obstacle avoidance capabilities while navigating both stationary obstacles and other UAS within shared airspace.

### Object Detection, Classification, and Localization

In this mission, teams must demonstrate their UAS's ability to detect, classify, and accurately locate objects. Standard and emergent objects, with specific characteristics, need to be identified, with telemetry uploaded at 1Hz for effective object detection.

### Mapping

The Mapping mission requires teams to generate high-quality imagery maps conforming to the Web Mercator projection. The evaluation focuses on map coverage, accuracy, and overall quality.

### Air Drop

Teams participating in the Air Drop mission are challenged to precision-drop a payload and design a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of carrying a standard water bottle. Points are awarded for accuracy in both the drop and subsequent drive to a specified location.
