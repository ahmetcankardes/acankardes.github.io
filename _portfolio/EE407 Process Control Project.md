## Overview
This project, done with my teammates [Furkan Karatoprak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/furkan-karatoprak-5991201bb/) and [Nermin Bozkurt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerminbozkurt/), explores control systems as part of the EE407 course at METU.

## Project Description

### Ball and Beam Control System
Our project centers around the Ball and Beam system, a classic setup for control algorithm design. The goal is to control the position of a ball, or in our case, a Hot Wheels car, on a beam using a DC motor and sensors. We opted for a Hot Wheels car with a straight surface to enhance measurement accuracy, addressing challenges with the Arduino ultrasonic sensor's precision on a round surface.
