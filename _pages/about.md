# ‚úã Hello there, I'm Ahmet!

I am a senior Electrical & Electronics Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. I am enthusiastic about delving into the field of robotics and am eager to pursue a master's degree to enhance my expertise and skills in this domain.

## Academic Journey üìñ

I graduated from Malatya Anatolian High School, securing the second position. Subsequently, after the university examination, I earned the opportunity to pursue my higher education at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The first year of my academic journey involved English Preparation School studies.

Upon completing the preparatory year, I transitioned to my undergraduate studies. During the course of my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in Control Theory. For my senior year, I specialized in Control Theory as my departmental option. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I engaged in various projects related to the courses I undertook. You can see some in Projects tab.

As part of the culmination of my academic journey, I am currently working on a graduation project with my team, 'Dinoco-Slam.' Our chosen project falls under the category of Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). For detailed insights into the department's graduation projects, you can visit [this link](https://capstone.eee.metu.edu.tr/projects-2023-24/).

## Volunteering

My interest in robotics ignited in 2019 when I encountered the [ANATEK aviation team at METU](https://www.anatek.org/) üõ©Ô∏è, showcasing a powerful quadcopter. This encounter led me to delve into electronics and software, sparking a fascination with the complexities of robotic reliability. Joining projects like the [AUVSI-SUAS 2022](https://suas-competition.org/competitions) competition and the [Teknofest 2023 Mixed Swarm Competition](https://www.teknofest.org/en/competitions/swarm-uav-competition/), I honed my skills in avionics, path-planning, and swarm intelligence. You can see more at Projects tab!!!

## Leadership and Soft Skills

As a key member of the ANATEK Team, I have honed essential soft skills and fostered interdisciplinary teamwork. In addition to technical pursuits, I drive educational initiatives, establishing programs in software proficiency and serving as the current team captain, overseeing projects and emphasizing cohesive team leadership.

## Professional Experience

In 2022, I broadened my horizons at [NETA≈û Telecommunications](https://netas.com.tr/?lang=en) as an intern, delving into electronic design and working on an 8W IP PoE speaker. The experience deepened my understanding of electronic circuit signal processing and circuit design.

During the summer of 2023, I interned at [Baykar Technology](https://baykartech.com/en/), gaining insights into UAV flight mechanics and implementing control algorithms for fixed-wing aircraft within the defense industry. The experience equipped me with practical knowledge of intricate dynamics and advanced algorithms in UAV operations.

## Motivation for Advanced Studies

My journey in robotics has fueled a desire to pursue a Master‚Äôs Degree in Robotics. I am particularly interested in exploring robotic perception, precise planning, and developing robust control solutions for autonomous systems.
